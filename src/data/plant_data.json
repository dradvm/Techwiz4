    "description": "A Calamondin is a hybrid fruit think half mandarin orange and half kumquat. They are edible with a sweet peel and a sour bite. They are especially great for baked goods, jams, and cocktails. Most notably, the calamondin\u0027s year round blooming cycle offers a stunning transformation of dark green leaves, white flower petals, and bright orange fruit. Calamondins are also known for the fresh citrus aroma they give off when in bloom.\nDepending on season, plants range from 18-22 inches tall and 6-8 inches wide. Plants are shipped in standard black one gallon growing pots, not in the white pot you see in the picture. Before we ship out we source the best product on the farm. Even though we can not guarantee blooms and/or fruit, we get first choice on the best for you.\nWe ship our trees from the farm on Monday and Wednesday mornings only. This guarantees three day shipping for each order.\n",

    "description": "The Holiday Cactus \u0027Schlumbergera bridgesii\u0027  This cactus produces small, flat stem segments that are roundish in nature, with minor serrations on both sides. They flower from the end of these segments. The flower produces a unique, tube-shaped �double flower� appearance, with the �outer� flower being formed by shorter leaves that curl back near the flower\u0027s base, and the �inner� flower being formed further up the flower, near the stamen. They bloom from mid-November and January\nIf temperatures are kept steady near the 68�F (20�C) mark, flowering can continue for eight weeks or more.\nGrowing medium: Free-draining, humus-rich, somewhat acid growing media are used for commercial production, such as a mixture of peat or leafmould and an inert material such as grit, sharp sand or polystyrene beads. It is recommended that plants should be grown in relatively small pots; half-height pots are suitable.\nWatering: They are more tolerant of drought than many house plants, but can be damaged by both under- and over-watering. Keeping the growing medium just moist throughout the year avoids either extreme.\nLight: They can be damaged by exposure to more than small amounts of sunlight. Members of the Buckleyi Group, such as the old-fashioned Christmas cactus with pendant flowers, are more tolerant of high light levels than members of the Truncata Group, such as most of the modern cultivars. Too much light causes stems to take on a reddish colouration; however, very low light levels will prevent flowering. Day length is important in controlling flowering; continuous darkness for at least 12 hours is necessary to induce bud formation. A period of about 8 days with 16 hours of darkness at 16 �C (61 �F) has been shown to cause flower buds to form. Lower temperatures slow this process. The advice sometimes given to withhold water to produce flower buds has been shown to be incorrect.\n",

Enjoys full sun growing up to 36?-48? and are best grown in 70�+ soil or start indoors ahead of time on a heat mat prior to settling outdoors.  Native to tropical Asia and Polynesia and considered an evergreen perennial tuberous herb. This Aroid plant will give you lots of pleasure all summer long with its huge, velvet or glossy textured, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are lined with darker veins. Spectacular as a sturdy backdrop for perennials in the flower border, although if you plant to set in most full sun situations, it will perform better if a soaker hose provides a little constant moisture. Excellent for water gardens when planted in a pot submerged in the pond.\n",
